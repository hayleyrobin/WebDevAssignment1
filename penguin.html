        Penguins are interesting animals as they are some of the only bird species
        that can't fly! The smallest type of penguin is only around 10 inches tall
        but the largest can grow to over four feet! Penguins have evolved to fly
        underwater and they will huddle together for different reasons! Finally, their
        white, black and yellow is a form of camouflaging!
