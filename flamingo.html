        Flamingos are one of the most beautiful bird species with 
        their vibrant pink feathers! The word 'flamingo' is derived from Latin
        for 'fire' because of their bright pink feathers. An interesting fact
        about these animals is that their backward bending knee is not a knee at all,
        it's actually an ankle! Tall flamingos can surprisingly grow as tall as six feet!
