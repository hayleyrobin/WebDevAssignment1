        Dolphins are beautiful sea animals that are extraordinarily intelligent. 
        Their signature whistle allows them to be distinctive to those 
        that need to recognize them. Dolphins live in groups and help 
        each other raise children and get food. They can also jump as high
        as 20 feet out of water! Don't be afraid to touch one as they are
        friendly and playful animals!
