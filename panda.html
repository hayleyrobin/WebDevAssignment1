        Pandas are your big, furry friends that have interesting
        facts about them. Known as the "lazy" animals, they eat and
        sleep all day, specifically bamboo! You'll most likely find
        them in trees as they are great at climbing as well as swimming.
        Pandas are also amazing at camouflaging to their environment! All 
        in all, they're very cute animals !
